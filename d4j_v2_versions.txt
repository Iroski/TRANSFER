I. Defects4J-V2.0.0 Bug Versions Used in Our Experiments:

Since some bugs in Defects4J-v2.0.0 cannot be checked out (e.g. https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/353) 
and reproduced (also mentioned in Grace(Lou et al. FSEâ€™21)), we finally use 226 bugs that can be reproduced on 
our machine for the experiment.

III. Program Repair Experimental Result on Defects4J-V2.0.0:

TBar can fix 4 bugs: Cli_5, Compress_24, Csv_9, JxPath_6
TRANSFER-PR can fix 6 bugs: Cli_5, Compress_19, Compress_24, Compress_27, Csv_9, JxPath_6


In our future work, we will conduct more comprehensive experiments to further evaluate the generality 
of our methods on more defect benchmarks.
